                <p>
                    I am a Software Engineer and I just graduated from Flatiron School. 
                    I grew up in San Jose, California. 
                    I always wanted to make applications for people to use.
                    I hope I am able to do that as a developer.
                    I am proficient in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and React. 
                    I would love to show you what I know and become an even better Software Engineer. 
                    I hope to be a Frontend Developer or a Fullstack Developer. 
                    I also would like to make video games as a hobby. 
                    I always enjoyed video games and would love to give the same feeling I felt as a child playing video games. 
                    Please check out my projects that I created in school and anything I am currently working on!
